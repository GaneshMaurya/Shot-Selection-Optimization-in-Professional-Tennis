# Shot Selection Optimization in Professional Tennis

This project predicts the **next shot's outcome** (Winner, Forced Error, Unforced Error) in a professional tennis rally using only coded rally strings and match metadata. It aims to bridge the data gap in tennis analytics and provide actionable, context-aware recommendations to players and coaches.
